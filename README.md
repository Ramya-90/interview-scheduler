# interview-scheduler
This repo contains code needed for the Qxf2 interview scheduler application. Please follow the setup instructions to start using the application.

--------------
1. MOTIVATION 
--------------

1. Allow Qxf2 to handle a large volume of interview candidates without having to bother about scheduling
2. Make the interaction with Qxf2 different from other companies 
3. Remind candidates at key moments during the process about Qxf2's features
4. Reduce (almost eliminate) exchange of emails between candidate and interviewer

The interview scheduler application should replace the scheduling work Gracy and Smitha did when we hired Rohini.
